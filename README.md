  ## Description
  (It's still in early dev, the openai stuff still needs to be intergrated)  

  A Discord bot that is initially prompted to harass you at every opportunity. This bot uses the GPT 3.5 turbo model for the most advanced form of insults. 
  
  This is just a personal project for me to mess around with new API's and npm packages. It's not intended to be a large-scale application.
  Response times will probably be slow since this project doesn't use Python.

  ## Installation
  After cloning the repo, update the .env.local to have a Discord Token, and add your OpenAI API key, then use "yarn dev" or "npm run dev"

  ## Usage
  The bot will respond to any comment/message that begins with !!.
